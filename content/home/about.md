# Background
I'm a freelance science writer and professor teaching statstics in Washington,
DC. At the age of 13 I started tutoring in math and science and pretty much
haven't stopped since. I studied engineering as an undergraduate and got my [PhD
in Statistics from Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu). Right
now I'm teaching statistics at various levels in American Sign Language at
[Gallaudet University](https://www.gallaude3t.edu), the world's only liberal
arts college for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. I use a lot of active
learning and creative pedagogy in my courses.

I also did a graduate program in [Science Communication at the University of
California-Santa Cruz](https://scicom.ucsc.edu). My specialty in science
journalism centers around data, probability, and statistics. My work has
appeared in _Nature_, _Los Angeles Times_, _New York Times_, _Reader’s Digest_,
_New Scientist_, and _Scientific American_, among others. My [feature article on
P-values in _Nature_] (https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700)
earned the American Statistical Association’s 2014 Excellence in Statistical
Reporting Award.

When I'm not writing or teaching I'm often speaking to a variety of audiences
about fun topics -- like why we just can't understand p-values, abuses and
misuses of statistics, all the ways our brain fools us during data analysis, and
the _right_ (and wrong) ways to communicate quantitative information.
