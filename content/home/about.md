# Background

I'm a professor teaching statistics in American Sign Language at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC. At the age of 13 I started tutoring and haven't stopped teaching since. I studied engineering as an undergraduate and got my [PhD in Statistics from Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu).

I also did a graduate program in [Science Communication at the University of California-Santa Cruz](https://scicom.ucsc.edu). My specialty in science journalism centers around data, probability, and statistics. My work has appeared in _Nature_, _Los Angeles Times_, _New York Times_, _Reader’s Digest_, _New Scientist_, and _Scientific American_, among others.

My [feature article on P-values in _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700) earned the American Statistical Association’s 2014 Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award. In addition to writing I also speak to a variety of audiences about cognitive bias and abuses in data analysis, “human-centered quantitative communication,” and the importance of properly and creatively framing statistical ideas.
