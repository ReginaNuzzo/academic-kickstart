A feature article in *Nature* about p-values. [Read it here.](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700)

For kicks you might enjoy checking out [what other people are saying about this piece, via Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/details/2115792).

Also check out the graphic on p-value calibration: If your p-value is 0.05 and your prior odds are 50:50, what is the minimum posterior probability for the null? (Spoiler alert: the answer probably isn't what you'd think. Unless you've see this graphic before, that is.)
