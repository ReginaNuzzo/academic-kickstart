The [NTTS series, New Techniques and Technologies for Statistics (NTTS)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/NTTS2019_en) is an international biennial scientific conference series, organised by Eurostat, on new techniques and methods for official statistics and the impact of new technologies on statistical collection, production and dissemination systems.

It will feature great speakers, stimulating content, new ideas and different perspectives. More than 400 people are expected to attend offering excellent learning and networking opportunities.

The purpose of the conference is both to allow the presentation of results from currently ongoing research and innovation projects in official statistics, and to stimulate and facilitate the preparation of new innovative projects (by encouraging the exchange of views and co-operation between researchers - including the possible building of research consortia) with the aim of enhancing the quality and usefulness of official statistics.

The NTTS 2019 is free of charge, offering various high-level publication possibilities after the presentation of an accepted oral or poster presentation at the NTTS conference.
