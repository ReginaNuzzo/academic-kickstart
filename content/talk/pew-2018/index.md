# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Expert science communicators have over the years developed a bag of tools and tricks for engaging with audiences over technical material. As a result, “SciComm” has come to be regarded as an important skill, worthy of study and development. But there’s a problem for us: many of those strategies simply do not translate well into the domain of data and statistics communication. Instead, we have an opportunity right now to develop a new model of communication designed just for us. Our tool bag can be filled with strategies for our own unique challenges, such as abstraction, information evaluation, and uncertainty. The purpose of this talk is to share some early ideas of this work in progress, explore new directions, and discuss potential ways forward. "
